cloudtty is an easy-to-use operator to run web terminal and cloud shell intended for a kubernetes-native environment.
You can easily open a terminal on your own browser via cloudtty.
The community is always open for any contributor and those who want to have a try.

Literally, cloudtty herein refers to a virtual console, shell, or terminal running on web and clouds.
You can use it anywhere with an internet conneciton and it will be automatically connected to the cloud.

> Early user terminals connected to computers were electromechanical teleprinters or teletypewriters (TeleTYpewriter, TTY), which might be the origin of TTY.
> Gradually, TTY has continued to be used as the name for a text-only console although now this text-only console is a virtual console not a physical console.

## Why Do You Need cloudtty?

A project [ttyd](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd) provides some features to share terminals over the web.
But if you use Kubernetes, a more cloud-native enviroment is required to run the webtty via the `kubernetes` way (running as a pod, and generated by CRDs),
which is covered by cloudtty. You are welcome to try cloudtty :tada:.

## Applicable Scenarios

1. Many enterprises use a cloud platform to manage Kubernetes, but due to security reasons,
   you cannot use SSH to connect the node host to execute `kubectl` commands.
   In this case, you may require a cloud shell capability.

2. A running container on kubernetes can be "entered" (via `Kubectl exec`) on a browser web page.

3. The container logs can be displayed in real time (scrolling) on a browser web page.

## Demo

After the cloudtty is intergated to your own UI, it would look like:

## Quick Start

- Step 1: Install the Operator and CRDs

  a. Install the operator using Helm

  ```shell
  helm repo add daocloud https://release.daocloud.io/chartrepo/cloudshell
  helm install cloudtty-operator --version 0.3.0 daocloud/cloudtty
  ```

  b. Wait for the operator pod until it is running

  ```shell
  kubectl wait deployment  cloudtty-operator-controller-manager   --for=condition=Available=True
  ```

- Step 2: Create a cloudtty instance by applying CR, and then monitor its status

  ```shell
  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudtty/cloudtty/v0.3.0/config/samples/local_cluster_v1alpha1_cloudshell.yaml
  ```

  By default, it will create a cloudtty pod and expose the `NodePort` service.
  Alternatively, `Cluster-IP`, `Ingress`, and `Virtual Service`(for Istio) are all supported as `exposureMode`, please refer to `config/samples/` for more examples.

- Step 3: Observe CR status to obtain its web access url, such as:

  ```shell
  kubectl get cloudshell -w
  ```

  You can see the following information:

  ```shell
  NAME                 USER   COMMAND  TYPE        URL                 PHASE   AGE
  cloudshell-sample    root   bash     NodePort    192.168.4.1:30167   Ready   31s
  cloudshell-sample2   root   bash     NodePort    192.168.4.1:30385   Ready   9s
  ```

  When the status of cloudshell changes to `Ready` and the `URL` field appears, copy and paste the URL on your browser to access the cluster with `kubectl`, as shown below:

## Advanced Usage Guide

### Manage Multiple or Remote Clusters

If cloudtty manages a remote cluster (another cluster than which the cloudtty operator runs on),
you need tell cloudtty the kube.conf of the remote cluster as below.

You can copy the kube.config `~/.kube/config` from a remote cluster.

```shell
kubectl create configmap my-kubeconfig --from-file=kube.config
```

Be careful to ensure the /root/.kube/config:

1. contains the base64 encoded certs/secrets instead of local files.

2. can reach the k8s api-server endpoint (via host IP or cluster IP) instead of localhost.

- If the cluster is remote, `cloudtty` needs to specify `kubeconfig` to access the cluster using the kubectl command tool.
  You need to provide the kubeconfig stored in configmap and specify the name to cloudshell `spec.configmapName` CR.
  kubeconfig will be automatically mounted to the cloudtty container.
  Ensure that the server IP address is properly connected to the cluster network.

- If cloudtty runs on the same cluster which to be managed,
  you don't need to do this (a ServiceAccount with `cluster-admin` role permissions will be binded to the pod automaticlly.
  Inside the container, kubectl automatically detects `CA` certificates and token.
  If any concern with security, you can also provide your own kubeconfig to control the permissions for different users.)

### More Exposure Modes

Cloudtty provides the following four modes to expose cloudtty services to satisfy different usage scenarios:

- `ClusterIP`: [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) ClusterIP type in a cluster,
  which is suitable for third-party integration of cloudtty server. You can choose a more flexible way to expose your services.

- `NodePort` (default): The simplest way to expose the service mode is to create a service resource with type NodePort in a cluster.
  You can access the cloudtty service using the master node IP address and port number.

- `Ingress`: Create a Service resource of ClusterIP type in a cluster and create an ingress resource to load the service based on routing rules.
  This works when the [Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) is used for traffic load in the cluster.

- `VirtualService` (Istio): Create a ClusterIP Service resource in a cluster and create a `VirtaulService` resource.
  This mode is used when [Istio](https://github.com/istio/istio) is used to load traffic in a cluster.

## Rationale

1. Operator creates a job and a service with the same name in the proper namespace.
   If Ingress or VitualService is used, it also creates the routing information.

2. When the pod status is `Ready`, it will show the access url to the cloudshell status.

3. When a [job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/) ends after the TTL is expired or the job is terminated for some other reasons,
   the cloudshell status changes to `Completed` once the job changes to `Completed`.
   You can set cloudshell to delete associated resources when the status is `Completed`.

4. When cloudshell is deleted, the corresponding job and service (through 'ownerReference') are automatically deleted.
   If Ingress or VitualService mode is used, the corresponding routing information will be deleted too.

## Developer Guide

### Run the Operator and Install CRDs

1. Generate CRDs to [charts/_crds]()

  ```shell
  make generate-yaml
  ```

2. Install CRDs

  ```shell
  make install
  ```

3. Run the operator

  ```shell
  make run
  ```

### Create cloudshell

For example, automatically print logs for a container.

```yaml
apiVersion: cloudshell.cloudtty.io/v1alpha1
kind: CloudShell
metadata:
  name: cloudshell-sample
spec:
  configmapName: "my-kubeconfig"
  runAsUser: "root"
  commandAction: "kubectl -n kube-system logs -f kube-apiserver-cn-stack"
  once: false
```

## Special Thanks

This project is based on https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd. Many thanks to `tsl0922`, `yudai`, and the community.
The frontend UI code was originated from `ttyd` project, and the ttyd binary inside the container also comes from `ttyd` project.

## What's Next

- Control permissions through RBAC (to generate the `/var/run/secret` file).

- For security, jobs should run in separate namespaces, not in the namespace same as  cloudshell.

- Check the pod is running and endpoint status changes to `Ready`, and the cloudshell phase is set to `Ready`.

- TTL should be set to both job and shell.

- Job creation templates are currently hardcode and should provide a more flexible way to modify the job template.
